		<p><b>Douglas Carl Engelbart  was an American engineer and inventor, and an early computer and Internet pioneer. He is best known for his work and he have a popular career. The mouse was found by him. Today mouse is very useful gadget. We complete our working fast with it.</b></p>
		
		<p>><b>Doug Engelbart invented the computer mouse in the early 1960s in his research lab at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). The first prototype was built in 1964, the patent application for this "X-Y position indicator for a display system" was filed in 1967, and US Patent 3,541,541 was awarded in 1970. Although many impressive innovations for interacting with computers have followed in the last 50 years since its invention, the mouse remains to this day the most efficient hands on pointing device available.[1]

		<h5><b>The First Mouse</b></h5>
		<p><b>The basic idea for the mouse first came to him in 1961 while sitting in a conference session on computer graphics, his mind mulling over the challenge of making interactive computing more efficient. It occurred to him that, using a pair of small wheels traversing a tabletop, one wheel turning horizontally, one turning vertically, the computer could track their combined rotations and move the cursor on the display accordingly. The wheels could function something like the wheels on a planimeter – a tool used by engineers and geographers to measure areas on a map, blueprint, drawing, etc. – but in this case, rolling the wheels around on the tabletop would plot the x,y coordinates for a cursor on a computer screen. He recorded the idea in his notebook for future reference.[2]

		<p><b>The Mouse Wins 3

		In 1965 Engelbart's team published the final report of their study evaluating the efficiency of the various screen-selection techniques. They had pitted the mouse against a handful of other devices, some off the shelf, some of their own making (see Mouse Alternatives below). The mouse won hands down, and was thus included as standard equipment in their research moving forward (see Screen-Selection Experiments below for links to key reports and papers detailing these experiments). In 1967, SRI filed for the patent on the mouse, under the more formal name of "x,y position indicator for a display system," and the patent was awarded in 1970.</b></p>
		<h5><b>His Vision</b></h5>
		<p><b>Engelbart went back to school after the war and received his degree in 1948. He then went to work for the NACA Ames Laboratory—the pre-cursor to NASA. By 1950, Engelbart began to grow restless. "I realized that I didn't have any more goals than a steady job, getting married and living happily ever after," and he asked himself, "How can my career maximize my contribution to mankind?" (Engelbart in O'Brien) He thought about how the world was growing ever more complex and remembered his experience reading Bush. He began to "envision people sitting in front of displays, 'flying around' in an information space where they could formulate and organize their ideas with incredible speed and flexibility." (Engelbart bio, Bootstrap Institute). This was, of course, well before the Internet or World Wide Web came into existence.[3]</b></p>
